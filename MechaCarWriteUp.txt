# Car RUs data analysis write up

We perfomred a multivariable regression analysis on the Mercha Cars data set to explore the relationship between miles per galon (mpg),
and vehicle length, weight, ground clearance and spoiler angle. Results suggests that the only variable that have a non-random amount 
of variance in mpg are vehicle length and ground clearance (p-value < signicance level). The slope of the line for this two variables
suggest positive correlation. The slope of the linear model is not considered to be zero because variance of residuals is positive. Finally 
this model is a good predictor as the R squared values is 0.7 (at least 70 percent of predictions are accurate); I would like to explore 
performance by only including variables that do not introduce variance in prediction due to randomness.

After exploring the super coil dataser, we see that the mean is 129.95, media in 149.97, variance is 76.23 and standard deviation is 8.73.
This showa design specifications for MerchaCar specificatios were not met because the median is above 100 and stantard deviations
does not shoe to have the data within the values desired.

The best way to see how MerchaCars outcompetes competence is by making looking at the frequency of cars bought and doing an chi-squared
test; wewoudl have to record the number of cars sold by our company and other companies. Statistical difference will signify that one company 
is selling more than the other dependeing on the difference in the frequency of cars bought before it gets squared. The null hyopthesis is 
'there is no difference in buying frequency between Merchacars and X company' and the alternative hypothesis is 'there is difference in 
buying frequencybetween MerchaCar and X company'.
